# Design
 - Players should have a sense of progress over time that is not based on skill. Example concepts:
  - 1: Buildings, units or resources persist and accumulate in a single global game over time
  - 2: Allowing AI helper macros / scripts to allow knowledge to accumulate and automate boring tasks and micro
  - I choose approach 2 for this game, because 1 has problems with veteran players having unbeatable advantage towards newcomers.
 - Players are focused on macro decisions while delegating micro to AI scripts
  - Manual intervention for micro should be possible, but the hope is that AI scripts will make it unnecessary
 - Support scaling to reasonable number of players
   - Server processes ticks in interval of 1 seconds with linear interpolation for movement
   - Server sends visible game state to each client per interval (not possible to cheat fog of war)
   - Client sends a list of actions per interval and server validates and executes it
    - Collect crystals
    - Building construction list
    - Unit construction list
    - Movement target per unit (should we allow subsecond movement list, e.g. for kiting?)
    - Attack list with times and coordinates per unit (fire rate may be subsecond)
 - Units
  - Properties
   - Health (hit points)
   - Armor (subtracted from damage taken)
   - Mass (used for computing blowback on hit)
   - Move speed
   - Collision radius
   - Weapon
    - Attack damage
    - Attack period
    - Impact time
    - Area of effect
    - Number of shots (how to animate?)
  - Melee units are simply units with 0.0 range
  - Balance: All players have access to the same units
  - Unit specs can be customized for each factory
   - 3D model+texture should indicate some unit properties for recognition
    - Each model+texture has a spec range
    - Each model+texture has a set of tags like Armored, Mechanical, Insect
     - Rock, paper, scissor dynamics are essential for varied strategies
   - Price and build time will be computed based on specs, for example
     - Adding armor reduces movement speed
     - Adding DPS increases cost and build time
     - Adding health increases cost and build time
   - Upgrades do not affect already built units
   - Changing factory specs is possible, but incurs a cost and reconstruction time
   - Each unit can be fitted with different weapons
    - Affects attack animation
 - Scouting should be very important
  - Seeing a unit for the first time reveals its health, mass, collision radius
  - Seeing a unit move for the first time reveals its move speed
  - Seeing a unit fire for the first time reveals its weapon properties
  - Seeing a unit take damage for the first time reveals its armor
  - Seeing a unit factory reveals all unit properties
 - Air units cannot overlap, unlike some other RTS.
  - This is just to unify collision mechanics.
  - Air units can fly over (low) ground units however.
